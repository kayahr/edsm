EDSM
====

This library provides classes for the data published on the Elite Dangerous Star Map (EDSM) and provides methods to
import the data in the formats specified by EDSM. It also provides a service to communicate with the EDSM API.

The library does not download the data dumps from EDSM. You have to do this yourself and then use this library to
parse the data.

Usage
-----

First install the library as a dependency in your project:

```
npm install @kayahr/edsm
```
